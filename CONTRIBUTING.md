### Here are the general steps to contributing!

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your local copy
3. Make your desired changes
4. Commit and Push your changes
5. Create a Pull Request

### Fork the repository

You can click [here](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/fork) to fork the repository

### Clone the forked repository to your local copy

Generally the forked repository would be under your account, so cloning it is as simple as

git clone https://github.com/<user>/resource-packs/
```

You can also use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) or [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) to clone your repository

- If you do clone with GitHub CLI, remember to set the proper default repository, else you won't be able to push!

If you are using GitHub Dev, the url to it would be https://github.dev/<user>/resource-packs

### Commit and Push your changes

Commits here have no general guidlines, but please keep it sensible!

Make sure to run [./pys/pre_commit.py](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/tree/main/pys/pre_commit.py) before commiting, for a proper formatting!

You can also view your changes to the web interface at [./webUI/index.html]
