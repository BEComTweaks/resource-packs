A repo containing every single tweak <b>possible</b> ported from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs">Vanilla Tweaks' Resource Packs</a> with a Web Interface.

Docs are available [here](https://becomtweaks.gitbook.io/docs)

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
