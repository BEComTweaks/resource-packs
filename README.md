# Bedrock Tweaks Base

A repo containing every single tweak ported from vanillatweaks.net
Currently, it isn't exactly completed. Starting on the packs related to Aesthetic

Tutorial on how this works is in [`docs`](https://github.com/NSPC911/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/tree/json-of-packs/docs)

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
