A repo containing every single tweak ported from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs">vanillatweaks.net</a> with a Command Line Interface as an example.

This can be used as a base for a website that someone can attempt for<br>
<sub>Hence why it is called <b>Base</b></sub>

Docs are available at [here](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/docs.md), along with a [tutorial](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/Tutorial.md) on the CLI 

How to clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/
cd Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/pys
echo 0 | python3 folder_creator.py
```
<sub>echo is to instantly start the script with no printing. For more information, refer to [Explanation of py files](https://github.com/NSPC911/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/Explanation%20of%20py%20files.md)</sub>

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
