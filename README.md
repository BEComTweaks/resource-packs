    A repo containing every single tweak ported from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs">vanillatweaks.net</a>
    <br>
    Currently, it isn't exactly completed. Starting on the packs related to Aesthetic
    <br>
    Tutorial on how this works is in <a href="https://github.com/NSPC911/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/tree/json-of-packs/docs"><code>docs</code></a>
    <br>
    Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
