A repo containing every single tweak **possible** ported from <a href="https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs">Vanilla Tweaks' Resource Packs</a> with a Command Line and Web Interface.

Docs are available at [here](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/docs/docs.md)

Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute to this project

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get pretty drained out from projects.
