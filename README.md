# Bedrock Tweaks Base
 A repo containing every single tweak ported from vanillatweaks.net
Currently, it isn't exactly completed. I am currently finishing up on the JSON files required for indexing the packs. Hopefully I get that done before I start on the folders for each topic and pack.

Tutorial on how this works is in `docs`

Pull Requests are greatly appreciated as I do not want this to be a single person project. I can get prety drained out from projects.
