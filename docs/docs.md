# Welcome to Bedrock-Tweaks-Base docs!

This is the main page for the documentation for the stuff in the repository.

There are currently 3 actual docs

1. [Explanation of json files.md](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/Explanation%20of%20json%20files.md)
2. [Explanation of py files.md](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/Explanation%20of%20py%20files.md)
3. [Tutorial.md](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/Tutorial.md)

Each serve their own purpose

Explanation of json files gives a rather detailed explanation for the way it is formatted and how the directories for [packs](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/packs) look like

Explanation of py files give a not-so-detailed overview of each python file in [pys](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/docs/pys) except for [main.py](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/pys/main.py), [selector.py](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/pys/selector.py) and [exporter.py](https://github.com/BedrockTweaks/Bedrock-Tweaks-Base/blob/main/pys/exporter.py).
<br>I recommend reading the comments in the code for a better overview on what is going on.
<br>The docs is just a compiled version that does not have the code

Tutorial is, well, a graphical tutorial on the CLI/TUI of the pack selection process
