# Welcome to BEComTweaks/resource-packs docs!

This is the main page for the documentation for the stuff in the repository.

There are currently 3 actual docs

1. [Explanation of json files.md](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/docs/Explanation%20of%20json%20files.md)
2. [Explanation of py files.md](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/docs/Explanation%20of%20py%20files.md)
3. [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Each serve their own purpose

Explanation of json files gives a rather detailed explanation for the way it is formatted and how the directories for [packs](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/packs) look like

Explanation of py files give a not-so-detailed overview of each python file in [pys](https://github.com/BEComTweaks/resource-packs/blob/main/docs/pys)

CONTRIBUTING outlines the things required for contributing to this repository

<br>I recommend reading the comments in the code for a better overview on what is going on.
<br>The docs is just a compiled version that does not have the code

<sub>Thanks for coming here! It helps a lot of you star this repo!</sub>
